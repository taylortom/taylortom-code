The responsibility of identifying the way to do things fell entirely to managers, and those doing the work were to be given very specific instructions in how to execute their very specific tasks with little if any explanation as to how that work might fit into the larger system or why it might be important.</p>\n\n<p>Fortunately, we now realize how misguided this theory was.</p>\n\n<p>While it&rsquo;s still usually a necessity to have teams run by managers or leaders, we now recognize that every person involved in the process is capable of complex thoughts and able to play an active role in decision-making. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, it&rsquo;s the front-line workforce who have the knowledge of what&rsquo;s working and what could be improved.

      "inlineTranscriptBody": "<p>In the classical literature on work and organizational design probably the most fundamental trade-off was between engagement and efficiency, meaning that you could either design work that was fun &ndash; people really enjoyed doing it &ndash; or work that was efficient. And the way you would get work typically that was highly efficient is it would be super-repetitive so you&#39;d just be doing the same task day in, day out for your entire career.</p>\n\n<p>And that presented the would-be work designer with sort of a difficult choice, which is I could either have happy employees or I could have really efficient ones that hated their jobs, right. And neither of those seemed like particularly good options. I think what the last 20 or 30 years has shown is that it is possible to break that trade-off and to have work that is both highly efficient and engaging. And the way you do that, essentially, is to engage the people doing the work in the process of making the work better.</p>\n\n<p>And this has the desirable property that you are first capitalizing on all the experience that people accumulate in their heads in doing that repetitive job day in and day out because the brain is constantly searching for new ways to do things better, and as that process continues more and more of the work has actually been designed by the workforce itself and so, therefore, they&#39;re going to be much more committed to following the rules because they were the ones that have had a hand in setting them.</p>\n\n<p>And probably the exemplar of that approach is the famous Toyota production system. Toyota has been at this for 50 years, the work is incredibly well designed, it&#39;s highly repetitive, but most of the good ideas that they have had, that have made it what it is, have come from the workforce itself.&nbsp;</p>\n",
